Import/export UI is present on the case list page, but backend import/export APIs and ID-collision/nextId handling are not evidenced in the provided backend diff excerpt, so REQ-13 appears incomplete based on available evidence.",

      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "Backend exposes APIs to export all cases and to import cases; import updates persistent canister state; import handles IDs safely (no collisions) and maintains correct behavior for creating new cases after import (e.g., next ID increments properly).",
      "reason": "Frontend includes import/export actions and hooks references, but the backend diff excerpt (backend/main.mo shown) does not include any export/import methods or logic for merging imported cases and updating nextId safely. Without those APIs/logic evidenced, REQ-13 cannot be confirmed as implemented.",
