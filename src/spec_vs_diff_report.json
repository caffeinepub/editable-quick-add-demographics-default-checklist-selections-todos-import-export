  "summary": "Implemented MRN matching utility and wired NewCasePage to pass fetched cases into CaseForm. CaseForm shows signs of new-case-only duplicate MRN detection (isNewCase guard, watch('mrn'), lastCheckedMRN ref, toast import) and uses a helper that selects the most recent match by arrivalDate then id. CaseForm logic is truncated, so some acceptance-criteria details cannot be fully verified from the provided diff snippet.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on duplicate MRN alert/autofill behavior during MRN entry on the New Case form; it does not request adding toasts around successful/failed case creation submission.",
